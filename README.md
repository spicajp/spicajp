# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## About Me

I am a graduate student in the master's program at a national university in Japan, specializing in science and technology.
My expertise lies in information technology, particularly **medical imaging technology**.
My research centers on the development of **X-ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography (XFCT)**, a novel medical imaging modality that provides functional images without the need for radioisotopes.
Additionally, I am actively involved in **deep learning-based image processing**, with a particular interest in improving the quality of medical images.
